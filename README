    YAC is a basic CMS Design Pattern with a simple user interface. No
    need to learn perl to play the YAC but a monk can play so well.

    A CMS needs features to create, edit, organize and publish content,
    ways to link and exchange the content in the web environment.

    As simple as an CMS can be, YAC implements a simple user interface
    around Catalyst. This open  design encourage YAC's contributions grow.

    The most important pattern is the open user interface paradigma. The
    idea about web interfaces can't neglect Ajax and the HTML 5 protocol.
