=head2 Control Structure

YAC can instance one of this 4 machines when run the YAC:

    . Play
    . Edit
    . Admin
    . Hack

Each machine can be used at specific role and rigths.

To complement and perform that machines are the Ws and Plugin controls.

=over 4

=item * Play machine

The default run is always the Play machine or Root control. Here the user can view media content and access basic navigational menus.

=item * Edit machine

A logged user with editorial rigths can access the Edit machine and change their work.

Edit machine presents the media content to edit.
The default editor is pure text.
Other media editor like html, widgets, code, image, animation, xml, svg, json and so on can be added by plugin hooks.

The menu is same as Play machine plus personal menus and editor menus. The adicional interface will be the personal data editor and menus editor. This new editors will be integrated in the same interface.


=item * Admin machine

If the user is logged with admin rigths he can access the Admin machine.

Admin machine presents interfaces for edit and administer users, their data and work.
Brings CMS's administration tasks like startup and shutdown the server or enable/disable some plugins.

YAC uses a file to store all users and stacks: the Container. It's a sqlite3 file and can be exchanged, uploaded, downloaded or merged among instances of the YAC at different sites.

The menu is same as Edit machine plus users and admin menus.

=item * Hack machine

With hacker rigths the user can access the Hack machine.

Hack machine presents interfaces to plugins, Catalyst hooks and some core helpers. Permit CMS's design and building tasks like create widgets, features or develop a new plugin.

The menu is same as Edit machine plus users and admin menus.

=head2 Model Structure

=over 4

=item * Stack

The content handler. The only must in YAC.

One can create cool stacks!!

The core implemented stacks are: Content, Control and Widget.


=over 4


=item Control

A menu manager

=item Content

Handles html content.

=item Widget

Handles js code content.

=item * Auth

The authentication class handle users, rules and rights.

=item * User

The user handler.

=item * Layout

The Layout objects are viewer Catalyst templates at database storage.

=item * Plugin

Plugins are Catalyst Plugins handlers.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

A CMS (Content Management System) can be a web tool used in some internet business to help and administer media publication. As a market lider let's consider B<Drupal>, a php based CMS, reference product used by everywere, a key tool in Obama's USA president campaign. The B<Drupal>'s grow in users (designers and coders) and contributed addons bring up to community a lot of php programmer's work and all market demmand for their code.

The media produced by CMS needs to integrate with other system like CRMs and ERPs or other enterprise legacy. The CMS's oportunity to programmers became from integration tools like a plugin system and addon facilities. It's the B<Drupal>'s case. That minimalistic simplicity is the strongest value. Programmers can hook systems in the CMS and final users can plug in at the website instantly.

The secret: The designer (or anybody) can do functional web without the coder. A CMS needs a simple and clear user interface. But the core integration to other systems where the coder works need to be simple too. Final result: Productivity.

In the Java, Python, Ruby or Asp world we will find similar tools like Typo, OpenCms, Django and Plone. Some simple, others powefull.

At perl tools we consider MovableType. Our work will not compete directly with MovableType as it integrates in Catalyst's control level as our implementation and plugin basis. The YAC's paradigma differ in our simplicity and minimalistic goal. Will be ok to one begin in YAC and integrates MovableType anytime.

The Catalyst Project need a extensible, basic CMS Design Pattern with the eyes in the final user and the hooks that a programmer can play. A CMS more simple than B<Drupal> and with the power of B<CPAN> and B<Catalyst>.

We will consider cpan tools like Reaction, Mojo and Dancer.

=head2 Deliverables

* A so basic CMS Design Pattern on Catalyst with some helpers, tools and simple layout.

* Ajax user interface to some Catalyst core functions.

* CPAN module as the first implementation.


=head2 Project Details

YAC will be a basic CMS Design Pattern with a simple user interface.
No need to learn perl to play the YAC but a monger will play so well.

A CMS needs, at least, to create, edit and publish content and to link that content as web address (urls) to navigation or command menus and links. A good addon is a theme manager. The access to the CMS and this features need to be defined at Access Control List.
The stronguest feature in the UI will be a simple plugin system integrated at cpan level.

The idea, as the first implementation, will be an extensible and basic ajax structure around jquery from Catalyst. Consider Catalyst::View::Component::jQuery.

As simple as an CMS can be, YAC will implement a simple user interface around Catalyst helpers, open hooks and plugins. This open design will encourage YAC's contributions grow.

The most important pattern to be done will be an open user interface paradigma.  The idea about web interfaces can't neglect Ajax and the HTML 5 protocol.
